# TV broadcasting

Me and my teammate Aly Mostafa, developed an analog communication system to modulate and demodulate video signals using: </br>
`VSB technique: a popular method in analog and digital communication and widely used in TV broadcasting.` </br>
- The video signal was processed frame-by-frame, applying VSB modulation and demodulation to each color channel (RGB).
- Demodulation was applied on each channel before combining them to reconstruct the video.
